    <h2>Processing Activities</h2>
    <h3>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h3>
    <h4>Type and Purpose of Processing</h4>
    <p>
      When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise
      transmit information, general information is automatically collected.
      These details (server log files) include, for example, the type of web
      browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet
      service provider, your IP address, and similar data.
    </p>
    <p>They are processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to the website</li>
      <li>Ensuring the smooth use of our website</li>
      <li>
        Ensuring and evaluating system security and stability, in particular for
        misuse detection
      </li>
      <li>Technical optimization and error-free presentation of the website</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use your data to draw conclusions about you personally. However,
      we reserve the right to check server log files retrospectively if there
      are concrete indications of unlawful use.
    </p>
    <h4>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h4>
    <p>
      Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR on the
      basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and
      functionality of our website, as well as ensuring system security and
      detecting misuse.
    </p>
    <h4>Recipients</h4>
    <p>
      Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as data
      processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.
    </p>
    <h4>Storage Duration</h4>
    <p>
      Data is stored in server log files in a form that allows identification of
      the data subjects for a maximum of seven days, unless a security-related
      event occurs (e.g., a DDoS attack).
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a case, server log files will be stored until the security-related
      incident has been resolved and fully clarified.
    </p>
    <h4>Provision Required or Necessary</h4>
    <p>
      The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor
      contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and
      functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. Additionally, some
      services may be unavailable or restricted.
    </p>

      communication with you.
    </p>
    <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
    <p>
      The processing of data is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)
      GDPR).

      Data will be deleted no later than six months after your inquiry has been
      processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a contractual relationship arises, we are subject to statutory
      retention periods. These are generally 6 or 10 years for reasons of proper
      accounting and tax compliance.
    </p>
    <h4>Provision Required or Necessary</h4>
    <p>
      The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only

    <h2>Information About Your Right to Object Under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
    <h3>Right to Object in Individual Cases</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to
      object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you which
